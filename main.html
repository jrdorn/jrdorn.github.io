              Born in San Jose, Josh Dorn grew up being constantly inspired by
              the spirit of innovation and positive change he saw around him in
              Silicon Valley. He graduated with highest honors from the
              University of California, Davis where he majored in linguistics
              and took several computer science courses to fulfill his major
              requirements. He is currently studying front-end engineering in
              Transition to Tech and is also interested in social impact
              investing and human-centered design. When not coding, you can find
              Josh reading, doing improv, and practicing Vipassana meditation.
