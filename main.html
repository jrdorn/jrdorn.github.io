    <p>Born in San Jose, Josh Dorn grew up being constantly inspired by the spirit of innovation 
      and positive change he saw around him in Silicon Valley. He graduated with highest honors 
      from the University of California, Davis where he majored in linguistics and took several 
      computer science courses to fulfill his major requirements. He is currently studying front-end 
      engineering in Transition to Tech and is also interested in social impact investing and 
      human-centered design. When not coding, you can find Josh reading, doing improv, and practicing Vipassana meditation.</p>
