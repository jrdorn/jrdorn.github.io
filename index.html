        Josh Dorn graduated with highest honors from the
        University of California, Davis with a major in linguistics. After taking a course on computational linguistics and an introductory Python course, 
        Josh knew he wanted to 
        continue studying computer science to build cool things to help people.
         He is currently studying front-end engineering in
        Transition to Tech and is also interested in social impact
        investing and human-centered design. When not coding, you can
        find Josh reading, doing improv, and practicing Vipassana
        meditation.

      <p>
        Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to
        bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do.
        That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
        way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our
        lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and
        I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
